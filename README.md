# TravelApp

This is a travel app that displays the nearest restaurants, hotels, and attractions around you using a geolocation API. Users can filter places by their rating
and see information such as stars, price, ranking, etc. This project was built using React, Google Maps API, Trusted Advisor API, and a Weather API.
